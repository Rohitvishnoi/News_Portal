The second Covid wave was not anticipated when such decisions were taken as the existing data didn’t indicate any possibility of it.<br><br>Most Indian people were in the general mood that the worst was behind them and the country was relatively safe from further spread of the infection and associated dangers. The five months of consistent decline in the rise of new cases and the fall of active cases gave us a foundation to back our planning and thought process on handling Covid further.<br><br>It was coupled with common problems like vaccine hesitancy and questions being raised over a vaccine developed in just 10 months. So, the larger public mood about taking vaccines was not totally favourable, especially when Covid was no longer looking like a serious problem to many.<br><br>So, even if Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) started making stockpiles of Covishield vaccine in 2020 only, the country did not place any advanced orders. By December 2020, the company had already produced around 5 crore doses of the vaccine and expected to increase it to 10 crore doses a month by March 2021. But it clearly said that scaling up the production process depended on the overall demand by the government.<br><br>Vaccination drive and orders<br><br>India began its vaccination drive on January 16, 2021. The first phase of vaccination in January was for around 1 crore healthcare workers (HCWs). A total of 37.58 lakh vaccines were administered, inoculating on average 2,34,927 HCWs per day. In February, around 2 crore frontline workers (FLWs) were added to the beneficiary list. A total of 1.05 crore doses of vaccines were delivered to HCWs and FLWs — with on average 3,76,515 doses administered per day.<br><br>Between January and February, the Government of India placed an order for 6.6 crore doses of Covishield and Covaxin – 5.6 crore doses of Covishield and 1 crore doses of Covaxin – for its 3 crore beneficiary target.<br><br>The country began its mass vaccination drive in March 2021. The targeted beneficiary base rose to 30 crore. The exercise administered 5.08 crore doses in March, or on average 16,39,246 vaccine doses a day.<br><br>The same month, the Government of India also placed an order for 12 crore doses – 10 crore Covishield and 2 crore Covaxin.<br><br>In the next phase of vaccination from April 1, the entire population above 45 years of age, or 34.51 crore people were included. The drive that month administered 8.98 crore vaccine shots, or 29,95,724 doses per day.<br><br>Disastrous second Covid wave pushed up demand for vaccines<br><br>The same month also saw the disastrous second Covid wave surging with April recording over 66 lakh cases and 45,882 fatalities and the country crossing the 200,000 mark of pandemic deaths.<br><br>With these worrisome peaks, the inoculation exercise was opened for all 94 crore adults of the country in the fourth phase of the drive in May, the month that saw the peak of the second Covid wave.<br><br>The active caseload burden touched 37 lakh cases. From 80,000 cases on April 1, the country hit the highest-ever single-day global record of 4.14 lakh new Covid-19 cases on May 6. The recovery rate saw a sharp decline: from more than 97% to less than 80%. Daily death figures were consistently high, in the range of 3,000-4,000 fatalities on many days. It crossed the highest-ever figure of 6,148 deaths on June 9, while the whole month saw 120,770 Covid fatalities.<br><br>Vaccine shortage<br><br>While the target population base from April to May expanded over 2.7 times with the number of people demanding vaccination increasing manifold after the second wave panic and the fear of another wave in the future, the manufacturing capacity available in the country remained the same: around 7 to 8 crore doses a month with almost no stockpile available. India’s pace of vaccinating its citizens dropped in May because of the lack of availability of vaccines. The month saw just 6.10 crore doses administered that comes to an average of 20.35 lakh doses a day, a fall of 32% from April. Efforts to import vaccines also failed as doses being produced abroad were already booked in advance.<br><br>Concerns were raised on vaccine shortage. Governments of states and union territories complained about the non-availability of doses, unfair distribution and differences in pricing between the Centre and the states under the liberalised vaccine policy that sought to decentralise decision-making.<br><br>The situation was worsened by vaccine hesitancy in small towns and rural India, the issue of the government’s CoWIN portal being available only in English, a digital divide between urban, small-town and rural India, high vaccine wastage rate in some states and the Centre’s move to supply free vaccines only to the 45+ population base while governments of states and union territories had to make a decision: either bear the cost of vaccines for the 18-44 population age group or make them payable. Faced with these difficulties, they soon realised that it was better if the vaccine drive remained under the control of the central government only.<br><br>ALSO READ | ‘Wanted to Reflect Indian Values’: Songwriter on Penning Lyrics to Mark India’s One Billion Vaccine Milestone<br><br>Corrective measures<br><br>The vaccination drive was again back under the central government’s control from June 21. It was followed by corrective measures like requesting Indian manufacturers to increase their production capacity, making CoWIN multilingual and ensuring distribution of vaccines as per caseload demand and vaccine wastage factors that the Government of India said was based on scientific formulation. The Centre also stopped vaccine export to other countries till conditions improved domestically.<br><br>Moreover, unlike the previous experience, the government this time went into overdrive to put bulk orders of vaccines, even including the ‘promising but not yet approved’ vaccines, adopting the line taken by countries like the United States and most European nations who put in advance orders even before the vaccination process had begun there. Orders for 16 crore Covishield and Covaxin doses were placed in May followed by 66 crore doses in July.<br><br>Also in April, with Russia’s Sputnik V getting approval, agreements were made with some Indian pharma companies to make India its global production hub, with a capacity to generate 85 crore doses annually. It was expected that by August, the local Sputnik V vaccine vials would arrive in the market.<br><br>In May, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech promised to raise their production level each to 10 to 12 crore doses by July to meet the increased demand. Though Covaxin failed on this front and India-made Sputnik V was yet to make headway in the Indian market, the government finalised a deal for advanced order with SII as its major partner to provide India at least 136 crore vaccine doses between August and December. 85% of this was Covishield while the rest was Covaxin. Additionally, the government also expected to get 2.5 crores doses each of Zydus Cadila and India-made Sputnik V vaccines.<br><br>Also, some additional deals may happen soon. SII is expected to launch the Covavax vaccine, the Indian version of the US vaccine Novavax, this month. According to Serum Institute, it has the capacity to produce 8 crore doses of Covavax a month. India has also paid in advance for 30 crore doses from Hyderabad-based Biological E for its under-development Corbevax vaccine.<br><br>And, above all, the central government decided to vaccinate people for free under the drive run by it – a major factor in drawing people across the country to the vaccination drive – in order to overcome vaccine hesitancy and make vaccines available to everyone, even the poorest Indian.<br><br>Rapid turnaround<br><br>The efforts paid off. People queued up for vaccination. And they got vaccines, unlike the last time, as supply was ensured.<br><br>ALSO READ | From Mountains to Boats, Commoners to Celebrities, A Glimpse of India’s 100-Cr Vaccination Feat | In Pics<br><br>The country that was once staring at an acute deficiency of vaccines just 4 months ago is now repeatedly beating its own targets. The expected supply for June was 11.95 crore Covid vaccine doses. The month saw 11.96 crore vaccinations. A total of 13.50 crore vaccine doses were to be delivered in July. The month recorded 13.45 crore jabs spread over 31 days. In August, the expected target was 15 crore doses. The month saw 22.5% more doses administered with a final figure of 13.38 crore monthly vaccinations.<br><br>In September, India was expecting 18 and 22 crore doses of Covid vaccines to be delivered. If we go by the lower limit set in the expected target, at 18 crore, September did better than August, jumping over 31 per cent with 23.60 crore doses. In October, India is expected to see around 27-28 crore doses of Covid vaccines delivered for vaccination.<br><br>Though the pace of vaccination has slowed down so far in October, it is not related to vaccine shortage anymore. As Covid cases and fatalities have seen a consistent decline after the second wave peak in May and chances of a third wave, that was once predicted to hit India soon, are now remote as new cases are driven only by the Delta variant and its other strains with no new mutant of concern emerging, registration on the CoWIN website for new vaccinations has steadily dipped. So, it is not about vaccine unavailability this time. It’s about people becoming negligent again in their attitude towards Covid, something that the country witnessed before the second wave.<br><br><a href=\'https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/road-to-a-billion-shots-how-indias-covid-vaccination-drive-picked-up-pace-despite-speed-bumps-4353776.html\'>Read More</a>', 1, 1, 1, '2021-10-23'),

It may sound a little impolite to some of the associate nations and the relatively weaker teams of international cricket but the reality is that T20 World Cup effectively starts from Saturday. Team India has often started as one of the favourites in any white-ball global tournament in the new century; however, this time, Virat Kohli and Co. are not being seen as out and out hot favourites. A lot has to do with the batting form of a captain who certainly has not been at his sparkling best either in international cricket or in IPL for nearly two years - lack of hundreds for the skipper is testimony to that. The team is again supposed to start with a top-order consisting of Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, and Kohli whose strike rate is under 130 and can have a huge bearing on the result of the match even if they score heavily individually. Besides that, India may still go with five bowlers which has severely affected their game plans in the previous World Cups as well as Hardik Pandya is yet to achieve bowling fitness.<br><br>T20 World Cup Full Coverage | Schedule | Photos | Points Table | Most Wickets | Most Runs<br><br><br><br>The multiple-World Cup winners in ODI format and one of the most dominant Test sides in the history of the game, the Australians are yet to make a second final appearance since 2010 in this format, let alone win a trophy. “A decade since the first T20 World Cup, this country’s best male players are still in adaptation mode, not quite sure how to play or value the format. They were overtaken by India, the West Indies, England and New Zealand several years ago and the gap is widening,” writes veteran Australian Journalist, author, and columnist Malcolm Knox in his column for Sydney Morning Herald which perhaps sum-ups the expectations of the Aussies.<br><br>The ODI World Champion England have been weakened by the absence of Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer but the World number 1 T20 side is still a formidable one. England captain Eoin Morgan may have been going through a horrid run as a batman but his experience (since the 2016 World Cup England‘s 50 matches have seen Morgan play in 45) may somehow have the same effect as MS Dhoni has had in Chennai Super Kings’ title triumph in the IPL 2021. However, in the last three T20 World Cups (2012, 2014, and 2016) which were hosted in Asia, England’s players don’t look as formidable and that could worry England.<br><br>ALSO READ: India vs Pakistan: Roots of the Epic Rivalry, Its Stars and First Encounters<br><br>West Indies may have entered the tournament with an ICC World ranking of 9 but it shouldn’t be forgotten that they are the only team with two World Cup trophies in this format (2012 and 2016), and can annihilate any team on a given day when they are on song. However, they will face some stiff competition from England, Australia, and South Africa in their group but they have better resources and more experienced campaigners for the pitches in this part of the world than other teams in the group. “The tournament is important to West Indies, and a third World Cup win in this format after those in 2012 and 2016 would be the cherry on top for a generation for whom time is ticking away. Chris Gayle, the leading run-scorer in T20 (with 14,276 runs), is 42 years of age; Dwayne Bravo, the all-rounder who is the format’s leading wicket-taker, is 38; Kieron Pollard, the captain, is 34; Andre Russell is 33,” wrote former England Captain Michael Atherton in his column for the UK’s The Times. Even without Sunil Narine (who had an outstanding UAE leg of IPL in 2021) and injury to another spinner Fabien Allen, West Indies may still intimidate the opponents regardless of their ordinary outings in the practice games this week.<br><br>If Pakistan’s Babar Azam(World number 2) and Mohammad Rizwan, (no one has scored more T20 international runs in 2021 than anyone in a year), and New Zealand’s Glenn Phillips,( this year’s leading T20 six-hitter) and Tim Southee, South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi (World’s number one spinner) along with the sensational pace duo of Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Sri Lanka’s Wanindu Hasaranga, Bangladesh’s Mustafizur Rehman (only pacer in top 10 of ICC T20I rankings along with Southee), Afghanistan’s Rahmanullah Gurbaz (a Powerplay beast) and Rashid Khan (we don’t have to say anything, right?) can live up to the expectations, they will also lift their teams, respectively.<br><br>And, yet more than anyone else, the next one month is likely to put Kohli under immense pressure to deliver as a T20 captain in his swansong tournament. The Indian captain had tears in his eyes when his IPL team failed to reach the finals earlier in this month and his Indian teammates would desperately want him to finish it off in a grand way.<br><br><a href=\'https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/t20-world-cup-2021-expect-a-desert-superstorm-in-a-battle-for-t20-supremacy-4354445.html\'>Read More</a>', 0, 1, 1, '2021-10-23');

Get ready for what’s next', 'India', 'Consumers around the world are about to get socked with even higher prices on everyday items, companies from food giant Unilever Plc to lubricant maker WD-40 Co. warned this week as they grapple with supply difficulties.<br><br>The maker of Dove soap and Magnum ice-cream bars jacked up prices by more than 4% on average last quarter, the biggest jump since 2012, and signaled elevated pricing will continue into next year. A similar refrain came from Nestle SA, Procter & Gamble Co. and Danone SA, whose products dominate supermarket aisles and kitchen cupboards.<br><br>“We’re in for at least another 12 months of inflationary pressures,” Unilever CEO Alan Jope said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We are in a once-in-two-decades inflationary environment.”<br><br>Companies are facing a dire mix of supply-chain challenges, as well as higher costs for energy, raw materials, packaging and shipping. While most consumer-goods makers reporting results this week expressed confidence that they’ll be able to limit the long-term hit to profitability, that means the pain passes to consumers, upping the squeeze on pockets as Christmas approaches.<br><br>U.S. inflation has accelerated rapidly this year to the strongest since 2008. Across developed economies, the post-pandemic supply-demand imbalances have pushed the rate above 4% for only the second time in the past two decades.<br><br>In the U.K., the cost of hedging against inflation over the next decade rose on Friday to the highest level in 25 years.<br><br>The return of pricing power marks a sea change in the global economy and poses a new challenge for central bankers after years of undershooting inflation targets. They’re trying to figure out whether they should quicken the removal of stimulus from pandemic-hobbled economies, or stand pat because the price spikes are temporary.<br><br>“This is a story that’s consistent across the world,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “It’s just something consumers have to resign themselves to right now.”<br><br>Companies typically raise prices gradually, which is why the start of an inflationary period usually damages profitability the most. If they pass on cost increases too quickly, shoppers will shift to cheaper products from competitors or put off purchases. Some are also locked into contracts, creating a delay in households feeling the pinch.<br><br>“You can’t pass on increases from one day to another,” Nestle CEO Mark Schneider said on Bloomberg TV this week. “But now that action is underway.”<br><br>Nestle’s overall pricing rose 2.1% in the third quarter, the fastest in at least five years.<br><br>Consumers in emerging markets have so far faced the biggest inflation, as seen in Nestle’s results. The Swiss food giant, which makes Nespresso coffee and DiGiorno pizzas, raised pricing in such countries by 2.6% in the first nine months of the year, three times the rate of developed markets. Schneider expects margins to drop this year given the time lag required to pass on higher costs. Then they should resume improving in 2022.<br><br>“What we see from the inflation front is that the situation is going to get worse and then of course we’re working on pricing to make up most of that,” Schneider said.<br><br>Danone has also indicated that shoppers in Europe and the U.S. won’t escape the squeeze. It expects costs to rise about 9% in the second half of the year. “We could see even higher inflation rates next year,” Chief Financial Officer Juergen Esser said on a conference call.<br><br>P&G, the maker of Downy fabric softener and Puffs facial tissues, expects $2.3 billion in expenses this fiscal year from elevated commodity and freight costs.

When was the last time you enjoyed a sundowner? Worry not, for reggae DJ and producer Rudy Roots has your back this weekend. <br><br>As the founder of Goa Sunsplash and a supporter of India’s reggae movement, Rudy is coming to Hyderabad for Olive Bistro’s Sunday Sunsplash, thrilled after more than 18 months of a too-quiet music scene in Goa.<br><br>“The last year and a half have been pretty productive for me and my team; we’ve been fighting to keep reggae music and the party scene alive in Goa even though it has been difficult globally. We’ve done live-streams too which has not been easy because Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other sites block people for copyright, which we understand, but we still kept the reggae fight on.” <br><br>Earlier this year, Rudy and his team hosted the first digital edition of Goa Sunsplash, and were thrilled at not just the new international audiences for the event, but also the new repertoire of artistes participating. “We, of course, miss the in-person festivals because that’s where you capture the energy and we have a sound system on the stage that makes a difference.” Rudy is also developing a venue at which some events have already taken place.<br><br>Coming to Hyderabad, will Rudy have to pivot a bit for his set at Olive Bistro? “The music I play is not so developed yet for Hyderabad; so when I play there, the few people who look for an alternative scene really enjoy it,” he responds. “Let’s see how this year goes as I am seeing a lot of interest around less mainstream music. On Sunday, I’m going to play the way I do in Goa, and I’m excited to see people react to that.”<br><br>Also performing for the night are MC Soopy from Delhi and Hyderabad-based Kayvee and Khushboo. Soopy has high hopes for a post-pandemic concert scene, explaining, “While I would hope for a complete return to normalcy, that might be a while away. I think venues, promoters and artistes need to be at the forefront of this post-pandemic scene and from now on place safety above everything. Hopefully we can soon put this chapter behind us and party like we used to.” <br><br>Goa has also undergone a renaissance, with the influx of domestic travellers and work-cationers. There are more restaurants, cafes and party venues offering something new to even the most regular visitor. “We saw a lot of old places closing, which was really sad. We also saw many new ones. This was drawing in new crowds, many of whom are coming to Goa for the first time. Also, people are spending more time here with no plans of going out of India. So there’s time and space to show Indians music they find new.”<br><br>Also Read | Goa’s new restaurants are now wooing locals with creative regional menus<br><br>With a busy festive season ahead and New Year’s ahead, Rudy is excited to see some movement in Goa already, injecting profits for businesses that have long struggled. “I’ve seen so much improvement in Anjuna and on Palolem Beach especially; the shacks in the area are now fancier and more well-made,” he describes, “We’re seeing a lot of Delhi and Mumbai investors, changing the energies and hopefully bringing better quality to businesses in the long run.”<br><br>Sunday Sunsplash with Rudy Roots, Soopy and Khushboo will be held at Olive Bistro on October 17 from 4 pm till 8.30 pm.<br><br><a href=\'https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rudy-roots-soopy-sunday-sunsplash-oct-2021-reggae-music-at-olive-bistro-hyderabad/article36979194.ece\'>Read More...</a>', 1, 3, 1, '2021-10-23'),

Get ready for what’s next', 'Business', 'Consumers around the world are about to get socked with even higher prices on everyday items, companies from food giant Unilever Plc to lubricant maker WD-40 Co. warned this week as they grapple with supply difficulties.<br><br>The maker of Dove soap and Magnum ice-cream bars jacked up prices by more than 4% on average last quarter, the biggest jump since 2012, and signaled elevated pricing will continue into next year. A similar refrain came from Nestle SA, Procter & Gamble Co. and Danone SA, whose products dominate supermarket aisles and kitchen cupboards.<br><br>“We’re in for at least another 12 months of inflationary pressures,” Unilever CEO Alan Jope said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We are in a once-in-two-decades inflationary environment.”<br><br>Companies are facing a dire mix of supply-chain challenges, as well as higher costs for energy, raw materials, packaging and shipping. While most consumer-goods makers reporting results this week expressed confidence that they’ll be able to limit the long-term hit to profitability, that means the pain passes to consumers, upping the squeeze on pockets as Christmas approaches.<br><br>U.S. inflation has accelerated rapidly this year to the strongest since 2008. Across developed economies, the post-pandemic supply-demand imbalances have pushed the rate above 4% for only the second time in the past two decades.<br><br>In the U.K., the cost of hedging against inflation over the next decade rose on Friday to the highest level in 25 years.<br><br>The return of pricing power marks a sea change in the global economy and poses a new challenge for central bankers after years of undershooting inflation targets. They’re trying to figure out whether they should quicken the removal of stimulus from pandemic-hobbled economies, or stand pat because the price spikes are temporary.<br><br>“This is a story that’s consistent across the world,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “It’s just something consumers have to resign themselves to right now.”<br><br>Companies typically raise prices gradually, which is why the start of an inflationary period usually damages profitability the most. If they pass on cost increases too quickly, shoppers will shift to cheaper products from competitors or put off purchases. Some are also locked into contracts, creating a delay in households feeling the pinch.<br><br>“You can’t pass on increases from one day to another,” Nestle CEO Mark Schneider said on Bloomberg TV this week. “But now that action is underway.”<br><br>Nestle’s overall pricing rose 2.1% in the third quarter, the fastest in at least five years.<br><br>Consumers in emerging markets have so far faced the biggest inflation, as seen in Nestle’s results. The Swiss food giant, which makes Nespresso coffee and DiGiorno pizzas, raised pricing in such countries by 2.6% in the first nine months of the year, three times the rate of developed markets. Schneider expects margins to drop this year given the time lag required to pass on higher costs. Then they should resume improving in 2022.<br><br>“What we see from the inflation front is that the situation is going to get worse and then of course we’re working on pricing to make up most of that,” Schneider said.<br><br>Danone has also indicated that shoppers in Europe and the U.S. won’t escape the squeeze. It expects costs to rise about 9% in the second half of the year. “We could see even higher inflation rates next year,” Chief Financial Officer Juergen Esser said on a conference call.<br><br>P&G, the maker of Downy fabric softener and Puffs facial tissues, expects $2.3 billion in expenses this fiscal year from elevated commodity and freight costs. It’s increased prices on numerous products and says the situation will continue to “evolve.”<br><br>The Federal Reserve said in a report on the U.S. economy this week that many firms are showing a “greater ability to pass along cost increases to customers amid strong demand.”<br><br>One measure of U.S. inflation expectations has surged to its highest since 2005 -- a signal that financial markets are losing faith in the idea of “transitory” inflation. In the U.K., price growth is heading for a rate that’s more than double the BOE’s target.<br><br>British consumers are particularly exposed as Brexit magnifies the challenges. The country’s hospitality sector is short about 500,000 workers and is facing cost inflation of as much as 18%, according to the Food and Drink Federation. Wages for truckers are surging as transporting goods becomes a nightmare for U.K. grocers.<br><br>The price pressure isn’t isolated to everyday items. Used-car buyers in the U.K. are spending about a quarter more than a year ago as surging demand clashes with low availability, according to Auto Trader Group Plc. It said 17% of vehicles less than a year old are more expensive than new equivalents.<br><br>Jay Rembolt, CFO of WD-40, the San Diego-based maker of industrial lubricants and cleaners, said on a conference call that the company is experiencing “significant increases” in transportation costs and fees from suppliers. It’s raising prices in response.<br><br>“We see prices staying elevated until the middle of next year before we start seeing some relief on the supply-chain front,” said Lee at BMO. “It’s a big struggle to work itself out.”<br><br><br><a href=\'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/trade/exports/insights/think-everythings-expensive-now-get-ready-for-whats-next/articleshow/87218535.cms\'>Read More...</a>', 1, 1, 1, '2021-10-23'),

(73, '1635259217.5146883.jpg', 'Explained: The algorithms that run Facebook', 'Tech', 'One of the biggest revelations from the Facebook Papers, a series of news reports based on internal company documents, was about a test account set up by a Facebook researcher in India in 2019. Within three weeks of signing up, the platform’s algorithms had filled the fictitious user’s news feed <br>with the worst that humanity has to offer, including fake news, gore, and celebrations of death.<br><br>While algorithms have long had a bad rap, they are simply lines of code. The real problem is how social media companies use them to keep us hooked to their platforms. Here’s a quick explainer on algorithms and how Facebook’s new feed has used them over the years.<br><br><br>What is an algorithm?<br>An algorithm is simply a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. A recipe for butter chicken is an algorithm; so is the method for doing long division. Every computerised device uses them. But these simple algorithms are nothing like the ones Facebook, Google and others use to keep their platforms running.<br><br><br>What are those like?<br>As we mentioned before, there’s no such thing as “the Facebook algorithm”. Instead, what you see in your news feed, and in what order, is the result of several complex algorithms working in concert, or in Facebook’s own words “multiple layers of machine learning models and rankings”. These algorithms are built to predict which posts will be “most valuable and meaningful to an individual over the long term”. <br><br>They evaluate every post, give it a score, and then serve them up to you in descending order. To give you an idea of the complexity involved, this process happens every single time one of Facebook’s 2.9 billion users refreshes their news feed.<br><br>If these complex algorithms didn’t exist, your news feed would simply serve up every available Facebook post to you in the order they were posted. In fact, those of a certain age will remember that this is exactly what Facebook’s news feed did before 2009.<br><br><br>How do Facebook’s algorithms rank posts?<br>While nobody but Facebook knows all the details of how its algorithms decide which posts to amplify and which ones to bury, the trove of internal company documents that <br>whistleblower Frances Haugen copied before she left the company offer some revealing glimpses.<br><br>The leaked papers show how algorithms designed for one purpose — maximising time spent on the platform — can end up recommending hateful, inciteful and gory content in India, or make Instagram a toxic platform for teenagers in the US.<br><br>What we also know is that in general, Facebook’s algorithms, like those of all ads-based social media companies, are designed to maximise the time that users spend scrolling through their feeds, so that they see more ads.<br><br><br>It’s important to note that algorithms, while automatic, are not autonomous. They operate strictly according to their program and must be told — by a human — which signals to pay attention to, and which outcomes to aim for.<br><br><br>How have Facebook’s algorithms evolved over the years?<br>As we mentioned earlier, Facebook’s algorithms have been growing in complexity since 2009, when it decided to rank and sort the items in users’ news feeds rather than serve them as in the order they were posted. Here are the milestones in the history of “the Facebook algorithm”.<br><br><br><br>2006: Facebook newsfeed debuts.<br>2007: Like button is introduced.<br>2009: Facebook begins a simple method of sorting posts; those with the most Likes get bumped to the top of the feed.<br>2015: Pages with too much promotional content (ads masquerading as posts start getting downranked. Facebook also lets users influence the algorithm directly by introducing the “See First” feature, which lets users tell Facebook to prioritise a certain Page’s posts in their feed.<br>2016: Facebook starts measuring a post’s value based on the amount of time users spent on it, even if they don’t like or share it.<br>2017: Facebook starts prioritising emoji-based emotional reactions over Likes.<br>2018: Responding to widespread criticism, CEO Mark Zuckerberg says in January that Facebook’s algorithms will now prioritise “posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions”.<br>2019: Facebook starts bumping up posts from “close friends” — those that people engage with the most. This comes after it received widespread criticism that its 2018 algorithm changes only ended up increasing outrage and divisiveness and promoting more misinformation and hateful content.<br>2020: Facebook announces that its algorithm will now evaluate the credibility and quality of news articles to promote substantiated news rather than misinformation.<br><br><br><a href=\'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/trendspotting/explained-the-algorithms-that-run-facebook/articleshow/87282136.cms\'>Read More...</a>', 3, 3, 1, '2021-10-26'),

In some cities, tomato costs Rs 100 per kg, pinching the pockets of people.<br><br>“There had been heavy rains in the last two months which have impacted both onions and tomatoes.
